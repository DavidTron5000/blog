description: "With a modern web development approach is there even a need for servers? Brian Douglas answers that question by exploring the implementation of into my front end web app that lets me know if there is a baseball game and when to avoid public transit. By the end of this talk, you will have a good understanding to build a fast, secure front-end that talks to a low-cost server-less architecture. You will also find out if there is a baseball game the night of the talk as well"
