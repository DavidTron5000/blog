Bring your laptop! This month, we’re trying out a new “hack night” format to give people time to ask questions, share ideas, and find collaborators on JAMstack projects. We’ll get things started with a 25-minute talk, then open the room for people to share what they’re working on (even if you’re just starting!)

## For example:

• Upgrading a web app to a Progressive Web App

• Adding Netlify CMS to your existing static site

• Building a single page app

• Converting your blog to a static site generator

• Adding HTTPS to your site

• Looking for cool web APIs

_We’ll have folks on hand to help answer questions, make suggestions, and just chat about all things JAMstack!_

## Agenda:

**6:30** - Pizza, drinks, and friendly faces

**7:00** - Jessica Parsons, “The Speedy Shiba’s Guide to Images on the JAMstack”

**7:30** - Share projects, ask questions, hack on the JAMstack!

## Talk:

The Speedy Shiba’s Guide to Images on the JAMstackOne of the biggest advantages to JAMstack projects is their speed, but much of this can be lost if images aren’t optimized. I’ll cover some basic tricks of the trade, including choosing the right image format and writing markup for responsive images, along with JAMstack-specific strategies like using an asset host so you don’t have to store all of your images in your project repo. There will also be lots of adorable pictures of my pet shibas.

## About the speaker:

Jessica Parsons has spent half her life teaching, and a quarter of it developing for the web. She now combines these passions as a Developer Support Engineer at Netlify. She also teaches and develops curriculum for Girl Develop It, helps with civic tech projects for Code for America/OpenSMC, and is co-organizing San Francisco’s first Code for Good event, coming this summer.
